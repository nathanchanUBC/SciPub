role playing made me feel like a TA;  role plays was a preview to TAing; and role plays were fun This feedback aligns with the purpose of using role plays in the training as a way to bridge the gap between knowledge of a teaching technique and actually using the technique Moreover, in all the written feedback forms collected in these four years, not one participant included a critical comment about the role play activities in their response to the question asking about how the workshop could be improved We attribute this to a positive training environment that supports role playing activities, an environment created by including the five elements as previously described IS MAD Other studies have highlighted the importance of debriefing role plays and providing explanations before a role play Fadali et al, 2000;
